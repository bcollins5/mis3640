I particularly wish to thank Bob Randall and Frank Kelley, who provided
much of the information used for the Bismarck-Mandan and Grand Forks
areas, respectively; my brother and almost constant field companion
Barry Zimmer, who helped with many suggestions; Kelly Stonecypher, who
provided inspiration and the best kind of moral support; and most
importantly, Jim Lane, whose advice, help, and encouragement made this
book possible.

Many others helped in some way, either with advice and information, or
as field companions. I want to thank the following, and after this has
gone to press I will probably think of others: Milan Alby, Steve Allen,
Beth Anderson, David L. Bartling, William Buresh, Gary A. Eslinger,
Palmer Forness, Ralph Fries, Ann and Bob Gammell, David Goeke, Harold
Holt, Harold Kantrud, Art Lies, Donald E. Lindberg, Jon M. Malcolm,
Rebecca Quanrud, Robert Rollings, Alan K. Trout, Robert Walkin, Dr.
Nathaniel Whitney, Hugh Willoughby, Jim Zimmer, and Bernard and Mary
Zimmer.
